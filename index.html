    <h3>What is Marth Club?</h3>
    <p>MARTH Club is a community of artists and learners who create art using code.<br> We believe in the following principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Community Support: We learn together. We create together. We help each other to learn and create.</li>
      <li>New-kid Love: We all start as beginners, and we never forget that. We strive to help others to grow by sharing our knowledge freely.</li>
      <li>No Code-snobs: When someone asks for help, we meet them at their level. We understand that everyone learns differently and that we are all at different levels of coding expertise.</li>
      <li>Open Source: We share our creations openly so that others might learn from our work and build upon it.</li>
    </ul>
